                <h2>Dimension 69</h2>
                <p class="c2"><span class="c1">His heart thrummed in his chest, ears ringing from the adrenaline that coursed through his body. This wasn&rsquo;t the first time he fought monsters in other dimensions, and it certainly won&rsquo;t be the last.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford hid behind a rusted metal beam, sucking in deep breaths to steady his heart rate. He pulled his laser gun from his holster, cocking back the trigger. It hummed as it charged with energy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shots from the enemy&rsquo;s blaster zipped past his head, causing Ford to flinch back into the beam. He counted.</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ducked out from his temporary shelter, aiming at the armed enemies. The gun rattled out rounds of electrified bullets, each of the assailants falling to the floor with a wordless </span><span class="c0">thud</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford&rsquo;s eyes scanned the barrel filled warehouse for any lingering enemies. Not sensing any more movement, he holstered his blaster again and released a sigh of relief. He ran a six fingered hand through his salt and peppered hair. He was </span><span class="c0">definitely</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;getting too old for this.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mission was to get some form of radioactive chemical that can only be found in this dimension. Dimension 69.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He internally cursed Sanchez for leading him here on this stupid quest. </span><span class="c7">But</span><span class="c1">, he was indebted to the drunk for saving his rear in dimension C137.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a loud groan, he treaded through the musty warehouse, each step of his boots echoing throughout the massive structure. Ford eyed each of the labeled boxes and barrels with scrutiny. A lot of this was illegal goods from </span><span class="c0">other</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;dimensions. Hell, one even had an infinity die in it.<br></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After some time, he finally located a box with a bright yellow hazard sign on it. Fingers gingerly cracking open the sealant, he peeked inside to see the contents&hellip;<br><br>&hellip; was jars of semen.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">Radioactive. Semen.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Ford double checked the transmitter on his wrist, reconfirming that this </span><span class="c0">was</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;indeed the chemical he was looking for. His hand shot up to slap his forehead.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He really hated Sanchez.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford had successfully dropped off the shipment to the depot Sanchez suggested. He was really looking forward to </span><span class="c0">not</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;seeing that crazy man in the future.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He massaged his fingers into the crook of his neck, releasing another heavy sigh. Every part of his body was sore. His feet carried him mindlessly, autopiloting through the foreign streets of this dystopian dimension. Neon lights flashed above, illuminating with crimson &ldquo;XXX&rdquo;s and crude visuals of naked women.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems the trend of this dimension was sex. Figures.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tired man readjusted his glasses as he read every building he passed. After passing the sixth brothel, he found just a regular hotel. Which, in itself, was surprising that it wasn&rsquo;t a </span><span class="c0">love hotel.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building looked old, wood rot nestled on the paint chipped structure. When Ford pushed into the entrance, the scent of mildew rushed his senses. Dust and cobwebs hung from the ceiling rafters, the lobby looking like an old Halloween prop set.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, he was thinking maybe a love hotel would be better maintained. However, he was already here. It was only for one night.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A beautiful blonde woman sat at the reception. A long, dainty finger played with a lock of her voluminous hair as she concentrated on a magazine on the desk. She wore a revealing uniform, her endowed bosom just barely pushing out of the top of her shirt.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, in his 40 years of life, was talking to women still so hard. Ford could feel the blood rise to his face as he approached her.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her brilliant blue eyes flashed up from the pages, taking in the approaching man hungrily. Her puckered, red lips pulled up into a predatory smile. &ldquo;Oh, my. Look at what we got here,&rdquo; she cooed out to him.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford swallowed hard. He forced himself to speak despite his throat closing on him. &ldquo;O-one room, please.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;One room? All for your lonesome little self?&rdquo; she hummed seductively at the mature man.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Y-yes,&rdquo; he could feel his ears starting to burn. &ldquo;F-for myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But a silver fox like you could use someone like me~.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Th-that&rsquo;s very sweet of you, but I will kindly pass.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pouted at the response. Dejectedly, she pulled out room keys from beneath the desk. &ldquo;Fiiiiine. Suit yourself. If you ever change your mind, though&hellip;&rdquo; She bit her lower lip.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford haphazardly reached into his trench coat, fingers trembling to pull out his wallet. He slapped a disconcerting amount of cash down on the table and swiped up the room keys. He didn&rsquo;t even wait to hear where his room was located. He was already rushing up the stairs - and away from the thirsty woman.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was a beautiful broad doing in this run down place? He decided not to dwell too much on the thought.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t take long for him to find the room. He flicked on the fluorescent light, causing a faint buzz to fill the room.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes adjusted to the sight of the rusted metal framed bed and the old dusty TV opposite of it. He prayed that tonight won&rsquo;t give him tetanus.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Locking the door behind him, he made his way to the bathroom. The tiles were sticky with strange, smelly residue. Though surprisingly, the rest of the room looked clean and modern. A waterfall shower nestled in the corner of the room, with an ornate vanity opposite of it. Ford heaved out a breath he was holding for a while. Thank God there was some sort of normalcy in this strange land.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to shrug off his beaten trench coat, tugging off at any piece of clothing that constricted his sore body. His cracked glasses were already chucked onto the vanity. The thought of the steamy, warm shower easing his worn muscles caused excited goosebumps to run up and down his skin. Flicking on the hot water of the shower, he let the steam fog the room - and his senses.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed his aching, naked body into the warm, watery embrace. The cascade of scorching fluid massaged his beaten form. Ford ran his palms over his face, feeling all the sweat and grime melt off of his graying stubble.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His weary eyes gazed down at his bare figure. It&rsquo;s been at least ten years since he was pulled from his home dimension. For so long, he was a scrawny nerd who barely left his study. But, now look at him. His knuckles grazed the definition of his abs, finger tips poking at the muscle crease just above his hips. He looked good for his age.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If only people back home could see him now. The mental image of socking Stan in the face bringing a small smile to his lips.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford&rsquo;s thoughts drifted back to university life. The droll, dusty library where he spent most of his time. The girl that he would study with.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wouldn&rsquo;t even recognise him if she were to see him now.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never had the guts to ask her out. But her dorky laughter and cute chatter made all those hours of studying so much more bearable.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her bouncy brunette curls, thick framed glasses, cute little freckles. The way she smiled, mouth full of braces, was enough to warm his heart.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she could see him now, would she be impressed?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would she want him?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ford thought of another universe where she would. Where he was brave enough to ask her on a date. That way he could taste her minty lips, feel the warmth of her body pressed against his. Those bountiful locks in his six digits, her sweet voice begging him.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His cock began hardening at all these unwholesome thoughts. But he didn&rsquo;t want to stop it. It&rsquo;s been much too long. The water of this place&hellip; it smelled sweet, and tastes like honey. Did they put aphrodisiacs in the water here? He decided not to think for once, and just feel.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand grasped his length, pleasure clouding every sense he had left. Fingers playing with his water soaked head, he gave a solid pump against his palm. A breathy moan escaped from his slack jaw.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He imagined the girl straddling him in the library, her blouse half done, dress hiked up her waist. Her wet pussy wrapping around his cock hungrily as he thrusted up into her tight core. He&rsquo;d take her supple breast and lavish it in his mouth, worshiping her body as if it were a holy symbol.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">In the shower, he braced a hand against the cold tile wall, hand pumping eagerly at his hardened dick. Each vivid image caused him to stroke harder and faster. Pleasure boiled in his veins, clouding his thoughts and vision. It wasn&rsquo;t long before the end drew near.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">His body trembled as hot jets of cum pulsed out of his dick, the sheer ecstasy of his climax burning his whole body. The white fluid splattered to the ground, only to be washed away by the warm stream of water.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">If only it could be in her.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><hr><p class="c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">It wasn&rsquo;t long after that he wrapped up his shower. He cuddled into the wrackety, old bed, blankets cradling his tender body. He wanted to run diagnostics on the water tomorrow. But&hellip; that is tomorrow&rsquo;s issue. His heavy eyelids closed reluctantly, the thoughts of cute girls in university still fresh on his mind.</span></p><p class="c4 c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">And how lonely this bed is right now.</span></p></span></p>
