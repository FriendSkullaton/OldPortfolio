A guestbook so that way people can leave the signature of who visited.

## Built
it was built with HTML, CSS, with a sprinkle of javascript for the update and visistor counter.

## What did I learn?
to be myself! let loose! have fun!!! add my whole personality into it (which is just weird and quirky)

## What did I struggle with?
I'm not entirely happy with the writing section, and not entirely happy with the projects section so far.
